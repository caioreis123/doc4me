This code defines a class called `Summarizer` that contains two static methods: `summarizeDocs` and `summarizeProject`. 

The `summarizeDocs` method takes a `config` object as a parameter and returns a `Promise` that resolves to `void`. It first calls the `getFileSummarizations` method to get a string containing summarizations of all the documents in a specified folder. Then, it calls the `summarizeProject` method to generate a unified summary of the project using the summarizations obtained from the previous step.

The `getFileSummarizations` method takes a `config` object as a parameter and returns a `Promise` that resolves to a string. It initializes a variable `fileSummarizations` as an empty string. It then uses the `Utils.getFiles` method to get a list of document files in a specified folder with a specific extension. It iterates over each file using a `for await...of` loop. If the file ends with certain auxiliary file names (e.g., SUMMARY_FILE_NAME, ASK_FILE, TOKENS_FILE), it skips the file. Otherwise, it reads the content of the file using the `Utils.readFile` method and checks if the content starts with an error message. If it does, it skips the file. Otherwise, it calls the `AI.askIA` method to generate a summarization sentence for the file. The file path and the summarization sentence are then appended to the `fileSummarizations` string. Finally, the `fileSummarizations` string is returned.

The `summarizeProject` method takes two parameters: `summarizationByFile` (a string containing a paragraph for each file explanation separated by `\n\n`) and `myConfig` (a configuration object). It returns a `Promise` that resolves to `void`. It calls the `AI.askIA` method to generate a project summary using the `summarizationByFile` string as input. It then concatenates the project summary with the `summarizationByFile` string, separated by a line of `############`. Finally, it calls the `Utils.writeFile` method to write the full summary to a file named `SUMMARY_FILE_NAME` in the specified folder.
